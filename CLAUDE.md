# Ragling

Docling-powered local RAG system with hybrid vector + full-text search. Indexes personal knowledge from Obsidian vaults, emails, ebooks, RSS feeds, code repos, and project folders. Shared document cache with per-group vector indexes. Everything runs locally — no cloud APIs, no data leaves the machine.

## Using ragling

Use `/ragling` — MCP tools, search patterns, collection types, and best practices.

## Developing ragling

Use `/contributing` — TDD workflow, required skills pipeline, quality gates, coding standards, and project constraints.

## NanoClaw integration

- `/nanoclaw` — set up ragling as the RAG backend for NanoClaw
- `/nanoclaw-agents` — reference for NanoClaw channel agents (scoping, path mappings, search patterns)
